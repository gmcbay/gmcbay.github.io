    </h1>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">An accessibility tool for quick text-chat-based callouts
        while
        playing Destiny 2 on console platforms like Xbox and Playstation.</p>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">Using an Android phone or tablet supporting Bluetooth LE
        (which most
        modern phones and tablets do) and a $30 <a style="color: #dedede"
            href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2829">Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit
            LE</a> connected to your Xbox or Playstation console, Transmat allows you to set up quick single-press
        buttons on your Android device that can send abitrary text strings to Destiny 2's
        text chat as if you typed them on a physical keyboard.</p>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">Ideal for when you need to quickly transmit pre-defined
        information to your fireteam in activities such as raids but voice chat is not an option for everyone in the
        fireteam. Much easier than trying to juggle a controller and a physical keyboard while actively playing!</p>

    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">UPDATE: I've made some changes to the Adafruit Feather code to better support PC as target platform for this project.
    Make sure you are using the latest version of the Adafruit Feather 32u4 code found here: https://github.com/gmcbay/Transmat_32u4/releases/download/Release%2F1.0.1/transmat_32u4.zip.
    To avoid having your own controller or mouse + keyboard input conflict with the input from Transmat you'll have to temporarily remove your hands from the controller or physical keyboard while
    the callout is transmitted, but this process is fast so it should still be much faster to use this than to physically type in your callouts.</p>

    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">It comes pre-configured with callouts for the Vow of the
        Disciple raid but you can also create your own custom callout pages for other raids or activities where
        information needs to be communicated in a timely fashion.</p>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">Currently only characters that exist on a US layout keyboard
        are supported. If anyone is interested in using a system like this with non-English languages please let me know
        and I can look into improving localization support, it just isn't something I have needed for my own usage thus
        far.</p>
    <hr>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">Transmat is Open Source. You can find the Android app code <a
            style="color: #dedede" href="https://github.com/gmcbay/Transmat_Android">here</a> and
        the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit
        LE code <a style="color: #dedede" href="https://github.com/gmcbay/Transmat_32u4">here</a> </p>

    <hr>
    <p style="color: #dedede; font-weight: bold; margin: 22px;">Setup - Android</p>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">Install Transmat from the Google Play Store (if Google Play
        is available on
        your Android device). You can find it <a style="color: #dedede"
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mcbay.transmat">here</a>.</p>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">If using an Android device (such as an Amazon Fire Tablet)
        that
        does not have Google Play Store access, you can sideload the Transmat application.
        Instructions for how to set up sideloading vary from device to device but you should be able to find information
        for your specific Android device
        using a web search for 'sideload apk (your-device-here)', for example <a style="color: #dedede"
            href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sideload+apk+fire+hd+7">'sideload apk fire hd 7'</a></p>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">If sideloading you can find the current version of the
        Android app apk <a style="color: #dedede" href="https://github.com/gmcbay/Transmat_Android/releases/download/Release%2Fv1.0.0/app-release.apk">here</a></p>

    <p style="color: #dedede; font-weight: bold; margin: 22px;">Acquire - Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE</p>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">You probably do not have an Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit
        LE device laying around already, so you'll likely have to buy one. These are small Arduino-compatible devices
        that
        support Bluetooth LE and use the ATmega32U4 processor which is particularly well suited for impersonating a
        physical USB keyboard. The best
        place to buy them is direct from Adafruit <a style="color: #dedede"
            href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2829">here</a></a></p>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">There are other variants of the Adafruit Feather device but
        this project requires the 32u4 version (to act as a virtual USB keyboard) with
        Bluetooth LE support so make sure the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE device is the one you purchase. If you
        only plan to use this device for Transmat, go ahead and buy the cheapest option
        labelled "Loose Headers - Soldering Required". Don't panic (if you aren't into electronics): This project does
        not actually use the IO pins on the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE device
        so despite the description no soldering will actually be required.</p>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">If you are in a rush and have Amazon Prime you can also
        choose to buy the device from Amazon <a style="color: #dedede"
            href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GJR9MNI">here</a>.</p>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">You will also need a USB A (male) to Micro B (male) cable.
        You may have one of these already. If not you can buy one while buying the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE
        either at <a style="color: #dedede" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/592">Adafruit</a> or <a
            style="color: #dedede" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07232M876">Amazon</a>. The exactly length of the
        cable is not
        important as long as it supports USB A male on one side (this side will plug into your console's USB port) and
        USB Micro B on the other side (this side will plug into the Adafruit device).
        <hr>
    <p style="color: #dedede; font-weight: bold; margin: 22px;">Setup - Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE</p>
    <p style="color: #dedede; margin: 22px; width: 50rem;">Once you have the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE device
        and the correct USB cable you will need to do a one-time setup using a PC (Windows or Linux) or Mac to write
        the Transmat firmware to this device. After the firmware is written to the device you won't need the PC or Mac
        anymore, so if you don't currently have your own PC or Mac this may be something you can do at school, work or
        on a friend's computer.</p>

    <ul>
        <li style="color: #dedede">To get started plug the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE device into the PC or Mac
            using the USB A to Micro B cable.<br />Plug the USB-A end into your PC or Mac and the Micro B end into the
            MicroUSB port of the Adafruit Feather 32u4
            Bluefruit LE device.<br />If things are connected and the device is getting power from the USB cord you
            should see a red LED light flashing on the device. This is good.</a></li>

            correctly up to this point the IDE should recognize the Adafruit Feather 32u4 on one of the available serial
            ports and display the board information after the port name (as seen in below screenshot).<br />
            Make sure to choose the serial port that has the Adafruit Feather 32u4 device attached, it may not be COM5

            <br />In the IDE window that opened with the Transmat firmware project click the upload button (looks like
            an
            arrow pointing right) in the top left corner of the Arduino IDE.

        <img src="img/upload.png">
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        <li style="color: #dedede">You should see some output at the bottom of the IDE window as the IDE compiles and
            uploads the code to the device.<br />If everything works correctly you should
            eventually see a "Done uploading." message.<br />If the upload fails for any reason the first time, try
            again. If it continues to fail feel free to contact me at george@mcbay.net and I will attempt to help you
            figure it out.</li>

        <img src="img/done.png">
        <br />&nbsp;<br />
        <li style="color: #dedede">Once the firmware is done uploading you can unplug the Adafruit device from the PC or
            Mac you are using and use the USB cable to plug the device into a USB port on your Xbox or Playstation
            console.<br />&nbsp;<br />
            A case is not required for the Adafruit Feather 32u4 Bluefruit LE but if you'd like one, Adafruit has 3D
            printable
            files on <a style="color: #dedede"
                href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2209964/files">Thingiverse</a><br />
            They offer a lot of case variations but the two files you'd generally want to use for this project are
            feather-case.stl for the main case bottom and feather-top.stl for the top of the case.<br />
            <br />
            At this point you should be ready to connect the Android app to the device.<br />&nbsp;<br />Run the Android
            app on your
            Android phone or tablet and click the Bluetooth icon in the upper-right corner to attempt to
            connect.<br />&nbsp;<br />
            The first time you attempt to connect you will have to answer some prompts to give the app access to
            Bluetooth LE.<br />&nbsp;<br />
            In order to access Bluetooth LE the app requires location access on older versions of Android, this is
            normal.
            <br />&nbsp;<br />The app doesn't store or transmit any location data.<br />&nbsp;<br />
            Once connected you can send your callouts!
